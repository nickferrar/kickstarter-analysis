# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
When dealing with musicals in Great Britain, the median goal is an outlier in the pledged donations so we should be pursuing projects within the median goal of about 2000. The data is heavily skewed right so the median goal is generally the better indicator of a project's success. Also, when working with musicals, a lot of failed projects have high goals and low pledges which might suggest people aren't willing to invest in a huge project so we should keep our projects a little more modest.
