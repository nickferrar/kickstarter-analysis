# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Module 1 Challenge
### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
#### Overview of Project:
Using analysis of *Kickstarter* projects under various entertainment categories such as movies, plays, musicals, journalism, food among others we are trying to visualize and explain which *Kickstarter* projects are successful based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Theater Outcomes By Launch Date Conclusions
This graph analyzes whether the *Kickstarter* project was successful or not based on the date that the project is expected to launch. 
When looking at Theater Outcomes vs Launch Date, the most successful launch times are in May, June and July so it would be best if we try to set our launch month in late Spring or Early Summer. It should also be noted that the dates that end in failure are pretty static across all of the months. This can be seen with the following [graph](https://github.com/nickferrar/kickstarter-analysis/blob/52fb6e8c158c8612a344551844f223a1bae611f9/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### Outcomes Based On Goals
This graph analyzes whether the *Kickstarter* project was successful or not based on its inital goal.
When looking at Goals vs Outcomes, we can see that the more modest the goal of the project, it is more likely to succeed as a project. From goals of 35000 to 44999 we see that there is about 2 thirds of them succeeding however this sample size is fairly small at only 9 projects so further analysis into what those projects are should be done before making any conclusions about the outcomes of those goals. This can be seen with the following [graph](https://github.com/nickferrar/kickstarter-analysis/blob/0d6c0fedf9cf1d355c367db82175d6b09e9acf2b/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

### Limitations Of This Data and Other Comments
When doing this analysis, some limitations that come up are that we only isolates launch dates and the goals separately but it's possible these factores affect each other. For example, we might have modest goals being done in May, June and July for reasons that we may have to analyze further. It is difficult to see which variable, Goal amount or Launch date, affects the outcome more. Other graphs we could then make Outcomes Based on Goal every Month.
Also, as stated earlier, the sample size on the goal outcomes for some of our brackets are fairly small so the data still gets affected a lot by one success or failure. The other graphs I suggested such as Outcomes Based on Goal in January would likely have a small sample size but there could be extra information gathered that way.
